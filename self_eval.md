# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
> I struggled for a while with syntax cleanup. Hashes seem to have the most complicated syntax so far with varying uses of ``=>`` vs `:`.
I also struggled with figuring out how to combine a hash with the each method, but once I found the documentation for it things made sense.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
>  Note taking is going quite well. I am taking notes on a physical notepad vs a text file and think that is helping things to stick better. I am finding it helpful to color code my notes, so important terms and code stands out clearly on the paper. I take the most helpful notes when reviewing the lesson on my own schedule vs during a live lesson it is difficult to be as thorough with notes as I would like to be.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
> Generally I try to mess around with the code some, but turn to Google pretty quickly if its not making sense. I think maybe I should try solving in code first more often. It seems like a delicate balance, because I want to solve the problem on my own because I want to get into that thinking pattern, but I also do not want to be stuck on the same thing for too long trying to figure out on my own.
